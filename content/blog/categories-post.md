Using a static site generator for creating product Webhelp can be a common and practical approach. Static site generators, like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby, are efficient tools for generating static HTML files from simple markup language, such as Markdown. Here are some advantages:

1. **Speed and Performance:** Static sites are faster to load since they consist of pre-built HTML files. This results in a better user experience, especially for online help where quick access to information is crucial.

2. **Simplicity:** Static site generators simplify the content creation process. Authors can write documentation using Markdown or a similar markup language, and the generator takes care of converting it into HTML.

3. **Version Control:** Static sites are easy to manage with version control systems like Git. This is beneficial when collaborating on documentation and tracking changes over time.

4. **Security:** Since static sites don't rely on server-side processing or databases, they are generally more secure and less prone to certain types of attacks.

5. **Hosting Flexibility:** You can host static sites on various platforms, including content delivery networks (CDNs), ensuring reliable and scalable access to your documentation.

However, it's important to note that static sites might have limitations when it comes to dynamic content or user interactions. If your product online help requires real-time updates or user-specific content, you might need to consider a dynamic solution or supplement your static site with client-side JavaScript for interactivity.

In summary, for many product Webhelp scenarios, a static site generator can be a practical and efficient choice, providing speed, simplicity, and ease of maintenance.
